arp_responder - respond to ARP requests with fake entries

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Given a file of IP address and MAC addresses

    192.168.2.189  C0:04:AB:43:22:FF
    192.168.2.190  D4:DE:AD:BE:EF:FF

this program will respond to any requests for these entries.

    $ sudo ./arp_responder eth0 addresses.txt
    ^C (quit)
    $

On an wired network if this program is running on machine A,
and then one of the entries is pinged by machine B, a complete
entry should appear for that address in the ARP table of machine B.

    (machine B)

Notice that even though the ping did not work an new ARP entry
for .190 appeared.

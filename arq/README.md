arq - Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) file transfer

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This example shows how to perform reliable data transfers
given unreliable operations by employing [Automatic Repeat
Request (ARQ)][arq] techniques.  In this case a grossly unreliable
sendto (packetErrorSendTo) is used to exaggerate errors.

    (terminal 1)
    ./snw-server
    Port: 16245

    (terminal 2)
    ./snw-client localhost 16245 data
    (output will be in data.out)

    md5sum data.*
    (should be identical)

To generate test data the 'dd' command can be used.
The following generates 5M of random data.

    dd if=/dev/urandom of=data bs=1M count=5

The ARQ scheme is a simple [Stop and Wait][arq] with a single bit sequence
number and no sliding window.  The timeout between resends can be
configured (in arq.h).  The optimal timeout is dependent upon the network
being used.
